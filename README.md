## 1.0 breaking change.

If you're upgrading from 0.x, please [read this](https://github.com/keajs/kea-saga/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#a-note-regarding-sagas-and-actions) regarding the breaking change of automatically bound actions in Kea. If you have just `connect`ed to your actions, everything should work as it did before.
